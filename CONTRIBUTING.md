# Contributing to Krizaka projects

Thank you for helping. Every Krizaka repository follows the same rules.

1. **Read the contract first.** Each repository has an `AGENTS.md` (its governance contract) — the
   architecture rules, invariants and definition of done. Changes that break it are not merged.
2. **Open an issue before large changes**, so the design is agreed before the code.
3. **Keep the gates green.** Run the repository's quality gates locally (lint, type-check, tests,
   build, docs check — listed in its README) before opening a pull request; CI runs them again.
4. **Generated content is generated.** Documentation and data marked as generated are rebuilt from
   the code, never edited by hand.
5. **One change per pull request**, with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`…).
6. **No secrets, ever** — configuration comes from the environment.
7. **Label and plan with the shared taxonomy** — [LABELS.md](LABELS.md) (`type:*`, `priority:*`, `product:*`, `area:*`);
   every issue lives on the [Krizaka Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/krizaka/projects/4) ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)).
